# Abstract

Our project uses USRP N210 Hardware Drives (UHD) and GNU Radio to collect signals being transmitted by differnt smart home sensors using different communication protocols such as WiFi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc. We try to find a way to identify and locate those sensors without prior knowledge of their exact locations or functions. We plan to develop a system that autonomously discovers and identifies wireless sensors in a smart home by analyzing RF signals, MAC addresses and communication protocols.
